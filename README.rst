NeuroR
======

Introduction
------------

NeuroR is a collection of tools to repair morphologies.

You can try NeuroR's functionality on MyBinder:

- Cut-plane detection - |cutplane|
- Morphology repair - |repair|

Morphology repair with NeuroR
-----------------------------

There are presently three types of repair which are outlined below.

Sanitization
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the process of sanitizing a morphological file. It currently:

- ensures it can be loaded with MorphIO
- raises if the morphology has no soma or of invalid format
- removes unifurcations
- set negative diameters to zero
- raises if the morphology has a neurite whose type changes along the way
- removes segments with near zero lengths (shorter than 1e-4)

Note: more functionality may be added in the future


Cut plane repair
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cut plane repair aims at regrowing part of a morphologies that have been cut out
when the cell has been experimentally sliced.

``neuror cut-plane repair`` contains the collection of CLIs to perform this repair.

Additionally, there are CLIs for the cut plane detection and writing detected cut planes to
JSON files:

- If the cut plane is aligned with one of the X, Y or Z axes, the cut plane detection
  can be done automatically with the CLIs:

.. code-block:: shell

   neuror cut-plane file
   neuror cut-plane folder

- If the cut plane is not one the X, Y or Z axes, the detection has to be performed
  through the helper web application that can be launched with the following CLI:

.. code-block:: shell

   neuror cut-plane hint

Unravelling
~~~~~~~~~~~

Unravelling is the action of "stretching" the cell that has been shrunk because of the dehydratation caused by the slicing.

The unravelling CLI sub-group is:

.. code-block:: shell

   neuror unravel


The unravelling algorithm can be described as follows:

* Segments are unravelled iteratively.
* Each segment direction is replaced by the averaged direction in a sliding window around this segment.
* The original segment length is preserved.
* The start position of the new segment is the end of the latest unravelled segment.

Installation
------------

NeuroR is distributed as a Python package available on PyPi:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install --pre neuror[plotly]

Note: NeuroR relies on the experimental version 2 of NeuroM, hence the ``--pre`` option.

Only Python 3.6 and above are supported.

Prior to running ``pip install``, we recommend updating ``pip`` in your virtual environment unless you have a compelling reason not to do it:

.. code:: console

    $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools


Building BlueRepairSDK from sources
-----------------------------------

To install the old BlueRepairSDK, use this script:

.. code:: bash

          #!/bin/bash

          ##########
          # BBPSDK #
          ##########

          git clone ssh://bbpcode.epfl.ch/common/BBPSDK --recursive
          cd BBPSDK
          git checkout 7ccfd867b43746909ac3429cf44e2e4014431bbf
          git submodule update

          cmake -DCLONE_SUBPROJECTS=ON
          sed -i 's/add_subdirectory(tests)/#add_subdirectory(tests)/' Lunchbox/CMakeLists.txt

          # Remove a word (2nd argument) from all files in a folder (1st argument) and its subfolder
          delete_recursive() {
              find $1 \( -type d -name .git -prune \) -o -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i "s/$2//g"
          }

          delete_recursive . -Wextra
          delete_recursive . -Wall
          delete_recursive . -pedantic

          make
          sudo make install
          cd ..
